# We're going to rely on an externally created network for our services to get around the 
# problem with docker compose using underscores in network and container # names (and thus 
# causing problems with invalid hostnames). See the comment on 
# 34e78d05af2a287030598e545341ada36e9d24c for more details. You can create this network by 
# running: 'docker network create graph'
